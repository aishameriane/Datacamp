# Authoring R Markdown Reports

## Introduction

R Markdown is a tool for reporting your results with R. It brings together the best ideas from literate programming, dynamic documents and reproducible research. With R Markdown you suplement your R code with interaction to come with a complete report. It's easy to update and work with code in this form, because it is all still there. Whe you are ready to deliver your results, R Markdown uses your code to produce a final report, which can be an HTML entry, a PDF paper, a Microsoft Word file or a slideshow. R Markdown can build each format from your code, which means you can distribute your work in multiple ways. And if your data ever changes, you can just re-run your code to build a new report.

To see how it looks like in real life, see the image below, which contains a R Markdown file coded in R Studio IDE.

When compiled, the PDF will look like this:

![PDF compiled from last image](img/002.png)

You can try to knit in other formats, like PDF:

![PDF compiled from code](img/004.png)


HTML:

Microsoft Word:

Or even a slideshow:

![Slides compiled from code](img/006.png)

When you compile your document, R Markdown will run your chunks of R presents in you code and add the results in the final output. This creates an ideal format for your reproducible research. Use R code to create numbers, tables and figures for your report. Your report will contain all the code needed to reproduce your result, the interation in your code will make it easier to understand. And if you find a mistake or if your data ever changes, you can easily re-render your file to create an updated report. 

R Markdown reports are very versitile, you can add multiple types of code, not just R. And you can add elements from the Shiny package to create interactive output, like an interactive slideshow.

**Example 1**

###### Data

The `atmos` data set resides in the `nasaweather` package of the *R* programming language. It contains a collection of atmospheric variables measured between 1995 and 2000 on a grid of 576 coordinates in the western hemisphere. The data set comes from the [2006 ASA Data Expo](http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2006/).

Let's first install the `nasaweather` package:

```{r}
# install.packages("nasaweather", results = 'hide') # It's commented because I already have it installed :P
```
  
If you already have the package installed, just call it using the `library()` function:

```{r}
library(nasaweather)
```

Some of the variables in the `atmos` data set are:

* **temp** - The mean monthly air temperature near the surface of the Earth (measured in degrees kelvin (*K*))

* **pressure** - The mean monthly air pressure at the surface of the Earth (measured in millibars (*mb*))

* **ozone** - The mean monthly abundance of atmospheric ozone (measured in Dobson units (*DU*))

You can convert the temperature unit from Kelvin to Celsius with the formula

$$ celsius = kelvin - 273.15 $$


And you can convert the result to Fahrenheit with the formula

$$ fahrenheit = \underbrace{celsius}_\text{lalala} \times \frac{5}{9} + 32 $$
  
```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
example_kelvin <- 282.15
```

For example, `r example_kelvin` degrees Kelvin corresponds to `r example_kelvin - 273.15` degrees Celsius.

**Example 2**

The R chunks can be used to show both code and results or just results. For the second, you need to specify `echo = FALSE` when opening the chunk, like this: ` ```{r, echo=FALSE}`. Let's try asking the summary for cars (from `datasets`) showing the code and then plotting the variables ommiting the code.

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

## R code for your report

R Markdown files begin with R. They are designed to display the results of code and for this course that will mean `R code`. The next examples has some code in R necessary to develop the ongoing lessons.

First, let's install and load 3 packages of our interest: `nasaweather`, `dplyr` and `ggvis`.

```{r, results='hide'}
#install.packages("nasaweather") # remove the hashtag symbol if you haven't installed yet!
#install.packages("dplyr")
#install.packages("ggvis")

library(nasaweather)
library(dplyr)
library(ggvis)

```

For example, let's combine `dplyr` package with the `atmos` data to create means for all variables:

```{r}
# The nasaweather and dplyr packages are available in the workspace

# Set the year variable to 1995
year <- 1995

means <- atmos %>% 
  filter(year == year) %>%
  group_by(long, lat) %>%
  summarize(temp = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE), 
         pressure = mean(pressure, na.rm = TRUE),
         ozone = mean(ozone, na.rm = TRUE),
         cloudlow = mean(cloudlow, na.rm = TRUE),
         cloudmid = mean(cloudmid, na.rm = TRUE),
         cloudhigh = mean(cloudhigh, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()

# Inspect the means variable
means
```

Can you see that each combination of latitude and longitude only appears once in `means`? `atmos` records multiple values for multiple dates at each location. means only records the mean value of all of the dates for each location. Now that we have the data we'll use, let's visualize it!

The sample code below uses ggvis functions to visualize the data. It displays a plot of temperature vs. ozone. We'll use ggvis to create several graphs for our R Markdown reports. Using the calculations from last example, let's make the plot.

```{r}
# Change the code to plot the temp variable vs the ozone variable
means %>% 
  ggvis(x = ~temp, y = ~ozone) %>%
  layer_points()
```

Now, let's create a model that uses temperature to explain the ozone levels:

```{r}
# Base prediction only on temp
mod <- lm(ozone ~ temp, data = means)

# Generate a model summary and interpret the results
summary(mod)
```

You're now in a familiar position: you've done some preliminary analysis, and you're ready to report your findings. Remember what your code does, as you will work with it again soon. 

## Markdown

Now that we have some analysis to report, let's look on how to create R Markdown documents. R Markdown documents are written in Markdown, a plain text formatting language. If you ever seen how webpages are made, you will understand how Markdown works. Behind every web page, the is a doc written in html. This document tells your browser how to build the webpage, is basically a set of instructions that your web browser runs into a webpage. This idea to write a set of instructions that your computer can render into a visual document is very usefull. Your computer can reapply the instructions in different cenarios, and the instructions are easy to distribute over the internet. It takes much less memory to transfer the text and images. Moreover, it is quicly and easy to type off instructions, way more easy and quickly than creating actual pages. However, HTML has a drowback: is complicated and tedious to write, it is also a bit hard to understand. 

Markdown was create to fix this problems. Like HTML, Markdown is a markup language, a setup of instructions that a computer uses to generate pages. However, Markdown was designed to look like a simple plain text. Just using simple marks, it can create pdf, html, word and slides. To learn Markdown, you just need to memorize about 27 signals, or marks. You can find a good reference guide for R Markdown here: [Reference guide](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf)
For an interactive tutorial, see here: [Interactive tutorial](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/lesson/1/).

You can use Markdown to embed formatting instructions into your text. For example, you can make a word _italicized_ by surrounding it in asterisks (or underscores), **bold** by surrounding it in two asterisks, and monospaced (like code) by surrounding it in backticks:

```
*italics*
**bold**
`code`
```

You can turn a word into a link by surrounding it in hard brackets and then placing the link behind it in parentheses, like this:

```
[RStudio](www.rstudio.com)
```
To create titles and headers, use leading hastags. The number of hashtags determines the header's level:

```
# First level header
## Second level header
### Third level header
```

To make a bulleted list in Markdown, place each item on a new line after an asterisk and a space, like this:

```
* item 1
* item 2
* item 3
```

You can make an ordered list by placing each item on a new line after a number followed by a period followed by a space, like this

```
1. item 1
2. item 2
3. item 3
```
**Example:**

The `atmos` data set resides in the `nasaweather` package of the *R* programming language. It contains a collection of atmospheric variables measured between 1995 and 2000 on a grid of 576 coordinates in the western hemisphere. The data set comes from the [2006 ASA Data Expo](http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2006/).

Some of the variables in the `atmos` data set are:

* **temp** - The mean monthly air temperature near the surface of the Earth (measured in degrees kelvin (_K_))

* **pressure** - The mean monthly air pressure at the surface of the Earth (measured in millibars (_mb_))

* **ozone** - The mean monthly abundance of atmospheric ozone (measured in Dobson units (_DU_))


In each case, you need to place a blank line between the list and any paragraphs that come before it.

You can also use the Markdown syntax to embed latex math equations into your reports. To embed an equation in its own centered equation block, surround the equation with two pairs of dollar signs like this,

```
$$1 + 1 = 2$$
```

To embed an equation inline, surround it with a single pair of dollar signs, like this: $1 + 1 = 2$.

You can use all of the [standard latex math symbols](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics) to create attractive equations.

Now that we revised both R codes and Markdown, you'll learn how to embed R code into your report. This gives you the best of both worlds: formatted text for narration, and precise R code for reproducible analysis.

# Embedding Code

## Knitr

R Markdown uses the [Knitr package](http://yihui.name/knitr/options/) to embed R code and its results in the finished document. Knitr lets you embed code in R Markdown into your R Markdown code in two ways, that you can see in the sample document. First, you can embed code into a line of text by placing the code within the text and surrounding the code with two backticks and the letter r. Second, you can embed longer pieces of code with a `code chunk`. A code chunk is one or more lines of code that begin with three backticks followed by a letter r in braces. It ends with a line with three backticks. 

When you render your R Markdown file by clicking the Knit icon at the top of the screen, Knitr will run each piece of code and add the results to the report. If the code has been embebed inline, Knitr will remove the backticks, the `r` and the code itself, literally leaving behind only the result, as it was part of the original text. If the code has been embebed in a code chunck, Knitr will remove the three backticks, the braces and de r.  By defaulr, Knitr will display the original code in the output as well the results. You can change this behavior with a set of options.

One usefull option is the parameter `engine`, which alows to write code in another language, for example, Python. When you compile the code, R Markdown will use the apropriate software to run pieces of code written in other languages.

You can embed R code into your R Markdown report with the knitr syntax. To do this, surround your code with two lines: one that contains ``` `` `{r} ``` and one that contains ```. The result is a code chunk that looks like this:

```{r}
# some code
```
When you render the report, R will execute the code. If the code returns any results, R will add them to your report.


## Cleaning

For the remainder of the report, we will look only at data from the year 1995. We aggregate our data by location, using the *R* code below.

```{r}
library(nasaweather)
library(dplyr)

year <- 1995

means <- atmos %>% 
  filter(year == year) %>%
  group_by(long, lat) %>%
  summarize(temp = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE), 
         pressure = mean(pressure, na.rm = TRUE),
         ozone = mean(ozone, na.rm = TRUE),
         cloudlow = mean(cloudlow, na.rm = TRUE),
         cloudmid = mean(cloudmid, na.rm = TRUE),
         cloudhigh = mean(cloudhigh, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()

```

Notice that this code does not display any results. It simply saves means so we can use it later. Did you notice that we included `library(nasaweather)` and `library(dplyr)` to be rerun in the last exercise? Each R Markdown document is given a fresh, empty R session to run its code chunks in. This means that you will need to define any R objects that this document uses - and load any packages that it uses - inside the same R Markdown document. The document won't have access to the objects that exist in your current R session.

You can customize each R code chunk in your report by providing optional arguments after the r in ``` '```{r} ```, which appears at the start of the code chunk. Let's look at one set of options.

R functions sometimes return messages, warnings, and even error messages. By default, R Markdown will include these messages in your report. You can use the message, warning and error options to prevent R Markdown from displaying these. If any of the options are set to FALSE R Markdown will not include the corresponding type of message in the output.

For example, R Markdown would ignore any errors or warnings generated by the chunk below.

```{r warning = FALSE, error = FALSE}
4+5
```

For the remainder of the report, we will look only at data from the year 1995. We aggregate our data by location, using the *R* code below.

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(nasaweather)
library(dplyr)
library(ggvis)
```


```{r}
year <- 1995

means <- atmos %>% 
  filter(year == year) %>%
  group_by(long, lat) %>%
  summarize(temp = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE), 
         pressure = mean(pressure, na.rm = TRUE),
         ozone = mean(ozone, na.rm = TRUE),
         cloudlow = mean(cloudlow, na.rm = TRUE),
         cloudmid = mean(cloudmid, na.rm = TRUE),
         cloudhigh = mean(cloudhigh, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()
```

Notice that splitting your code in different chunks does not change anything about the availability of the results. Although the `library()` functions have been executed in another chunk, the packages are still available in the next chunk.

Three of the most popular chunk options are echo, eval and results.

If `echo = FALSE`, R Markdown will not display the code in the final document (but it will still run the code and display its results unless told otherwise).

If `eval = FALSE`, R Markdown will not run the code or include its results, (but it will still display the code unless told otherwise).

If `results = 'hide'`, R Markdown will not display the results of the code (but it will still run the code and display the code itself unless told otherwise).

**Example**

####Data

The `atmos` data set resides in the `nasaweather` package of the *R* programming language. It contains a collection of atmospheric variables measured between 1995 and 2000 on a grid of 576 coordinates in the western hemisphere.

* **pressure** - The mean monthly air pressure at the surface of the Earth (measured in millibars (*mb*))

* **ozone** - The mean monthly abundance of atmospheric ozone (measured in Dobson units (*DU*))

You can convert the temperature unit from Kelvin to Celsius with the formula

$$ celsius = kelvin - 273.15 $$

And you can convert the result to Fahrenheit with the formula

$$ fahrenheit = celsius \times \frac{5}{9} + 32 $$

####Cleaning

For the remainder of the report, we will look only at data from the year 1995. We aggregate our data by location, using the *R* code below.

```{r message = FALSE}
load(url("http://assets.datacamp.com/course/rmarkdown/atmos.RData")) # working with a subset
library(dplyr)
library(ggvis)
```

```{r}
year <- 1995
means <- atmos %>% 
  filter(year == year) %>%
  group_by(long, lat) %>%
  summarize(temp = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE), 
         pressure = mean(pressure, na.rm = TRUE),
         ozone = mean(ozone, na.rm = TRUE),
         cloudlow = mean(cloudlow, na.rm = TRUE),
         cloudmid = mean(cloudmid, na.rm = TRUE),
         cloudhigh = mean(cloudhigh, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()
```

####Ozone and temperature

Is the relationship between ozone and temperature useful for understanding fluctuations in ozone? A scatterplot of the variables shows a strong, but unusual relationship.

```{r, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 5, echo = FALSE}
means %>% 
  ggvis(~temp, ~ozone) %>%
  layer_points() 
```

We suspect that group level effects are caused by environmental conditions that vary by locale. To test this idea, we sort each data point into one of four geographic regions:
  
```{r}
means$locale <- "north america"  
means$locale[means$lat < 10] <- "south pacific"
means$locale[means$long > -80 & means$lat < 10] <- "south america"
means$locale[means$long > -80 & means$lat > 10] <- "north atlantic"
```

##### Model

We suggest that ozone is highly correlated with temperature, but that a different relationship exists for each geographic region. We capture this relationship with a second order linear model of the form

$$ ozone = \alpha + \beta_{1} temperature + \sum_{locales} \beta_{i} locale_{i} + \sum_{locales} \beta_{j} interaction_{j} + \epsilon$$

This yields the following coefficients and model lines.

```{r}
lm(ozone ~ temp + locale + temp:locale, data = means)
```

```{r, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 5, , echo = FALSE}
means %>% 
  group_by(locale) %>%
  ggvis(~temp, ~ozone) %>%
  layer_points(fill = ~locale) %>%
  layer_model_predictions(model = "lm", stroke = ~locale) %>%
  hide_legend("stroke") %>%
  scale_nominal("stroke", range = c("darkorange", "darkred", "darkgreen", "darkblue"))
```

##### Diagnostics

An anova test suggests that both locale and the interaction effect of locale and temperature are useful for predicting ozone (i.e., the p-value that compares the full model to the reduced models is statistically significant).

```{r}
mod <- lm(ozone ~ temp, data = means)
mod2 <- lm(ozone ~ temp + locale, data = means)
mod3 <- lm(ozone ~ temp + locale + temp:locale, data = means)

anova(mod, mod2, mod3)
```


You can embed R code into the text of your document with the r syntax. Be sure to include the lower case r in order for this to work properly. R Markdown will run the code and replace it with its result, which should be a piece of text, such as a character string or a number.

For example, the line below uses embedded R code to create a complete sentence:

The factorial of four is `r factorial(4)`.

When you render the document the result will appear as:

The factorial of four is 24.

Inline code provides a useful way to make your reports completely automatable.

We can recode the earlier example to apply some of this concepts.

#### Data

The `atmos` data set resides in the `nasaweather` package of the *R* programming language. It contains a collection of atmospheric variables measured between 1995 and 2000 on a grid of 576 coordinates in the western hemisphere.

You can convert the temperature unit from Kelvin to Celsius with the formula

$$ celsius = kelvin - 273.15 $$

And you can convert the result to Fahrenheit with the formula

```

For the remainder of the report, we will look only at data from the year `r year`. We aggregate our data by location, using the *R* code below.

```{r message = FALSE}
library(nasaweather)
library(dplyr)
library(ggvis)
```

```{r}
means <- atmos %>% 
  filter(year == year) %>%
  group_by(long, lat) %>%
  summarize(temp = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE), 
         pressure = mean(pressure, na.rm = TRUE),
         ozone = mean(ozone, na.rm = TRUE),
         cloudlow = mean(cloudlow, na.rm = TRUE),
         cloudmid = mean(cloudmid, na.rm = TRUE),
         cloudhigh = mean(cloudhigh, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()
```

where the `year` object equals `r year`.


#### Ozone and temperature

Is the relationship between ozone and temperature useful for understanding fluctuations in ozone? A scatterplot of the variables shows a strong, but unusual relationship.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 5}

```

```{r}
lm(ozone ~ temp + locale + temp:locale, data = means)
```

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 5}
means %>% 
  group_by(locale) %>%
  ggvis(~temp, ~ozone) %>%
  layer_points(fill = ~locale) %>%
  layer_model_predictions(model = "lm", stroke = ~locale) %>%

```

mod2 <- lm(ozone ~ temp + locale, data = means)
mod3 <- lm(ozone ~ temp + locale + temp:locale, data = means)

anova(mod, mod2, mod3)
```

## Labeling and reusing code chunks

Apart from the popular code chunk options you have learned by now, you can define even more things in the curly braces that follow the triple backticks.

An interesting feature available in knitr is the labeling of code snippets. The code chunk below would be assigned the label simple_sum:

```{r simple_sum, results = 'hide'}
2 + 2
```
However, because the results option is equal to hide, no output is shown. This is what appears in the output document:

2 + 2
What purpose do these labels serve? knitr provides the option ref.label to refer to previously defined and labeled code chunks. If used correctly, knitr will copy the code of the chunk you referred to and repeat it in the current code chunk. This feature enables you to separate R code and R output in the output document, without code duplication.

Let's continue the example; the following code chunk:

```{r ref.label='simple_sum', echo = FALSE}
```
produces the output you would expect:

```
 ## [1] 4
```

Notice that the echo option was explicitly set to FALSE, suppressing the R code that generated the output.

# Compiling Reports

## Pandoc

Now let's see how to transform your R Markdown file into a finished format. This process uses the program [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/), created by John MacFarlane. Until now we rendered our documents in HTML format, but if you click the arrow on the Knit button, you'll see other options like PDF, Word documents or Slideshow. 

You can control the render process nore precisely by adding an YAML header to your file. The YAML header is a collection of key value pairs separated by columns, and the header itself is demarcated by lines of three dashes (---). R Markdown will look for the header in your document and won't include it in your output. However, R Markdown may use information in the header to customize the output. For example, you can specify a title to be used, as well the name of the author and the date. 

If you assign an value to the variable `format` in the YAML, the value will determine the format the document will be rendered into. 

* *html_document* will produce an HTML document;
* *pdf_document* will produce a PDF file;
* *word_document* will produce a document in docx format;
* *beamer_presentation* will produce a slideshow in PDF format;
* *slidy_presentation* and *ioslides_presentation* will produce slideshows in HTML format.

If you are not using R Studio IDE, you can use the _render()_ function, available in `markdown` package. The first argument is the filename from de Rmd file (remember to use quotes) and the second is the format to render. You can render in multiple formats, using _c()_ funcion, like `render("doc.rmd", c("html_document", "pdf_document"))`.

## Example

The R Markdown file below describes the cloud data in the atmos data set. Change the output field to make the document render as a pdf, and re-render the document.

Notice that to visualize data in a pdf document, you will have to use the ggplot2 package as an alternative to the ggvis package. This is for a reason: the ggvis package creates graphs that are HTML objects. These graphs are useful for HTML documents, but cannot be included in a pdf document without intermediary steps.

#### Data

The `atmos` data set resides in the `nasaweather` package of the *R* programming language. It contains a collection of atmospheric variables measured between 1995 and 2000 on a grid of 576 coordinates in the western hemisphere. The data set comes from the [2006 ASA Data Expo](http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2006/).

Some of the variables in the `atmos` data set are:

* **cloudlow** - The mean percent of the sky covered by clouds at low altitudes.

* **cloudmid** - The mean percent of the sky covered by clouds at mid-range altitudes.

* **cloudhigh** - The mean percent of the sky covered by clouds at high altitudes.

You can convert the temperature unit from Kelvin to Celsius with the formula

$$ celsius = kelvin - 273.15 $$

And you can convert the result to Fahrenheit with the formula

$$ fahrenheit = celsius \times \frac{5}{9} + 32 $$

#### Cleaning

```{r echo = FALSE}
year <- 2000
```

For the remainder of the report, we will look only at data from the year `r year`. We aggregate our data by location, using the *R* code below.

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(nasaweather)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
```

```{r}
means <- atmos %>% 
  filter(year == year) %>%
  group_by(long, lat) %>%
  summarize(temp = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE), 
         pressure = mean(pressure, na.rm = TRUE),
         ozone = mean(ozone, na.rm = TRUE),
         cloudlow = mean(cloudlow, na.rm = TRUE),
         cloudmid = mean(cloudmid, na.rm = TRUE),
         cloudhigh = mean(cloudhigh, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()

clouds <- means %>%
  select(-(temp:ozone)) %>%
  gather("altitude", "coverage", 3:5)
```

### Slides

R Markdown will start a new slide at each first or second level header in your document. You can insert additional slide breaks with Markdown's horizontal rule syntax:

```
***
```

Everywhere you add these three asteriks in your text, pandoc will create a new slide.

### Specify knitr and pandoc options

ach R Markdown output template is a collection of knitr and pandoc options. You can customize your output by overwriting the default options that come with the template.

For example, the YAML header below overwrites the default code highlight style of the pdf_document template to create a document that uses the zenburn style:

```
---
title: "Demo"
output:
  pdf_document:
    highlight: zenburn
---
```
The YAML header below overwrites the default bootstrap CSS theme of the html_document template.

```
---
title: "Demo"
output:
  html_document:
    theme: spacelab
---
```
Pay close attention to the indentation of the options inside the YAML header; if you do not do this correctly, pandoc will not correctly understand your specifications. As an example, notice the difference between only specifying the output document to be HTML:

```
---
output: html_document
---
```
and specifying an HTML output document with a different theme:

```
---
output:
  html_document:
    theme: spacelab
---
```

The available themes for html documents are: default, cerulean, journal, flatly, readable, spacelab, united, or cosmo.

You can learn more about popular options to overwrite in the [R Markdown Reference Guide](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf).

## Shiny

Shiny is an R package that uses R to build interactive web apps such as data explorers and dashboards. You can add shiny components to an R Markdown file to make an interactive document.

When you do this, you must ensure that

* You add `runtime: shiny` to the file's YAML header
* You use an HTML output format (like `html_document`, `ioslides_presentation`, or `slidy_presentation`).

To learn more about interactivity with Shiny and R, visit [shiny.rstudio.com](shiny.rstudio.com).

### Example 1


```
---
title: "Shiny Demo"
author: "DataCamp"
output: html_document
runtime: shiny
---
```
This R Markdown document is made interactive using Shiny. Unlike the more traditional workflow of creating static reports, you can now create documents that allow your readers to change the assumptions underlying your analysis and see the results immediately. 

To learn more, see [Interactive Documents](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_shiny.html).

#### Inputs and Outputs

You can embed Shiny inputs and outputs in your document. Outputs are automatically updated whenever inputs change.  This demonstrates how a standard R plot can be made interactive by wrapping it in the Shiny `renderPlot` function. The `selectInput` and `sliderInput` functions create the input widgets used to drive the plot.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
inputPanel(
  selectInput("n_breaks", label = "Number of bins:",
              choices = c(10, 20, 35, 50), selected = 20),
  
  sliderInput("bw_adjust", label = "Bandwidth adjustment:",
              min = 0.2, max = 2, value = 1, step = 0.2)
)

renderPlot({
  hist(faithful$eruptions, probability = TRUE, breaks = as.numeric(input$n_breaks),
       xlab = "Duration (minutes)", main = "Geyser eruption duration")
  
  dens <- density(faithful$eruptions, adjust = input$bw_adjust)
  lines(dens, col = "blue")
})
```

#### Embedded Application

It is also possible to embed an entire Shiny application within an R Markdown document using the `shinyAppDir` function. This example embeds a Shiny application located in another directory:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
shinyAppDir(
  system.file("examples/06_tabsets", package = "shiny"),
  options = list(
    width = "100%", height = 550
  )
)
```

Note the use of the `height` parameter to determine how much vertical space the embedded application should occupy.

You can also use the `shinyApp` function to define an application inline rather then in an external directory.

In all of R code chunks above the `echo = FALSE` attribute is used. This is to prevent the R code within the chunk from rendering in the document alongside the Shiny components. Click [here](http://shiny.datacamp.com/rmarkdown-apps/rmarkdown_1.Rmd) to see de document rendered.


### Example 2

```
---
title: "ggvis"
author: "DataCamp"
output: html_document
runtime: shiny
---
```

ggvis provides a number of ways to enhance plots with interacticity. For example, the density plot below allows users to set the kernel and bandwidth of the plot.

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(ggvis)

mtcars %>% ggvis(x = ~wt) %>%
    layer_densities(
      adjust = input_slider(.1, 2, value = 1, step = .1, label = "Bandwidth adjustment"),
      kernel = input_select(
        c("Gaussian" = "gaussian",
          "Epanechnikov" = "epanechnikov",
          "Rectangular" = "rectangular",
          "Triangular" = "triangular",
          "Biweight" = "biweight",
          "Cosine" = "cosine",
          "Optcosine" = "optcosine"),
        label = "Kernel")
    )
```
